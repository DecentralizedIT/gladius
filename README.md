## Preparing development environment

1. `git clone` this repository.
2. Install Docker. This is needed to run the Test RCP client in an isolated
   environment.
2. Install Node Package Manager (NPM). See [installation
   instructions](https://www.npmjs.com/get-npm)
3. Install the Solidity Compiler (`solc`). See [installation
   instructions](http://solidity.readthedocs.io/en/develop/installing-solidity.html).
4. Run `npm install` to install project dependencies from `package.json`.

## Dependency Management

NPM dependencies are defined in `package.json`.
This makes it easy for all developers to use the same versions of dependencies,
instead of relying on globally installed dependencies using `npm install -g`.

To add a new dependency, execute `npm install --save-dev [package_name]`. This
adds a new entry to `package.json`. Make sure you commit this change.

## Code Style

### Solidity

We strive to adhere to the [Solidity Style
Guide](http://solidity.readthedocs.io/en/latest/style-guide.html) as much as
possible. The [Solium](https://github.com/duaraghav8/Solium)
linter has been added to check code against this Style Guide. The linter is run
automatically by Continuous Integration.

### Javascript

For plain Javascript files (e.g. tests), the [Javascript Standard
Style](https://standardjs.com/) is used. There are several
[plugins](https://standardjs.com/#are-there-text-editor-plugins) available for
widely-used editors. These also support automatic fixing. This linter is run
automatically by Continuous Integration.
